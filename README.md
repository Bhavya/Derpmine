What is this?
=============
"This", codename "Derpmine", is the alternative to the University of Waterloo's current co-operative education and internship web-application, Jobmine. The reason for its existence is due to to the untimely cancellation of its succesor, WaterlooWorks. 
This project is not meant to be out of disrespect to the University of Waterloo, nor to CECS; instead, it is a project meant to inspire others, and to show others what we believe our job management system should look like. 

Why open source?
----------------
The Waterloo community is known for its tech prowess. Why not take advantage of it? Fork away!

What will it look like?
-----------------------
Mockups will be up shortly.
